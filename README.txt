<script>jsorm.js</script> 
<script>jsormdb.js</script>

2) Limitations
jsormdb uses POST to submit changes/writes to the data store. Obviously, if you are working
off the local file system rather than a true Web server, the writes will fail.

3) Overview
jsormdb provides an advanced database in JavaScript, backed by any form of database or store on the
server. jsormdb is able to update itself from the server, as well as send updates back to the server.
These updates can be the entire data set, just the journal of changes, or a condensed version. 
jsormdb has the concept of transactions. Each change is kept in a journal, and can be rejected or
committed. Rejection rolls back all changes since the last commit, or since the initial load. Commitment
commits all changes since the last commit, or since the initial load. Additionally, commit sends changes
back to the server via ajax, if so configured. 

4) Build
If you wish to build and/or test on your own, you can do so. 

jake cleanbuild

will do it. You must have the following installed on your system to build:
- node
- npm packages: jsmin, rimraf, underscore,jake (all inside package.json)
